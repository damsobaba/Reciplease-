# Reciplease-
This project is the tenth of the iOS Developer path from OpenClassrooms. 
Reciplease allows you to search for recipes based on ingredients. You can also keep your favorite recipes as favorites.
The application is therefore divided into two parts: research and favorites. You can navigate between the two parts thanks to a Tab bar.

This app is:

responsive in all iPhones in portrait mode,
dependent on Alamofire, CoreData and the Edamam API,
managed by CocoaPods,
conform to MVC,
covered by unit tests.

# Installation

Please register in the Edamam API to get your own APP_ID and APP_KEY.
